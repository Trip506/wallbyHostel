										<p>Sometimes it helps to break down simple things into a short collection of visual objects like six pillars. Quite simply, I teach you how to think and I teach you the skills to work efficiently.</p>

									<h2>Language Talent</h2>

									<p>I have a natural talent for languages and find them very easy to learn. With this talent, my skills and inspiration in life, I created my unique teaching method and this platform. I am a qualified and experienced online language&nbsp;trainer, a native speaker in English and speaker of seven languages</p>
									<ul>
										<li>English</li>
										<li>German</li>
										<li>Spanish</li>
										<li>French</li>
										<li>Dutch</li>
										<li>Russian</li>
										<li>Arabic (Morocco)</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										As a critic of the current school system, I search for alternative teaching and learning methods where you learn much more than just how to memorize and pass your exams. Have a look around the
